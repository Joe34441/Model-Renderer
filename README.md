# Model Renderer
 
A model renderer made in C++ using OpenGL, GLM, Glad, GLFW and Dear IMGUI. The program reads through object, material and tga files to correctly draw the model, which the user can then adjust through its transform properties accessible within the GUI. The user can also customise the viewable scene with the grid lines, background and skybox.
